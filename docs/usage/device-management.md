The package uses device fingerprinting to reliably identify and manage user devices. Each device is assigned a unique fingerprint based on browser characteristics, IP address, and other factors.

## Device Fingerprinting

Device fingerprinting uses SHA-256 hashing to create a unique identifier for each device. This is more reliable than using just IP address and user agent, as it accounts for multiple factors.

### How It Works

When a user logs in, the package automatically:
1. Generates a device fingerprint using browser characteristics
2. Creates a friendly device name (e.g., "Chrome on Windows")
3. Checks if the device has been seen before
4. Stores the device information with the authentication log

## Getting User Devices

Get all devices that have been used by a user:

```php
$user = User::find(1);
$devices = $user->getDevices();

// Returns a collection with:
// - device_id
// - device_name
// - ip_address
// - user_agent
// - is_trusted
// - login_at (most recent)
```

## Trusting Devices

Mark a device as trusted to allow it access to sensitive actions:

```php
$user = User::find(1);
$deviceId = 'abc123...'; // Device fingerprint

// Trust a device
$user->trustDevice($deviceId);

// Check if device is trusted
if ($user->isDeviceTrusted($deviceId)) {
    // Device is trusted
}
```

## Untrusting Devices

Remove trust from a device:

```php
$user = User::find(1);
$deviceId = 'abc123...';

$user->untrustDevice($deviceId);
```

## Updating Device Names

Allow users to customize device names for easier identification:

```php
$user = User::find(1);
$deviceId = 'abc123...';

$user->updateDeviceName($deviceId, 'My Work Laptop');
```

## Example: Device Management UI

```php
// In your controller
public function devices()
{
    $user = auth()->user();
    $devices = $user->getDevices();
    
    return view('profile.devices', compact('devices'));
}

// In your view
@foreach($devices as $device)
    <div class="device-item">
        <div>
            <strong>{{ $device->device_name }}</strong>
            @if($device->is_trusted)
                <span class="badge badge-success">Trusted</span>
            @endif
        </div>
        <div>
            Last used: {{ $device->login_at->diffForHumans() }}
        </div>
        <div>
            <form action="{{ route('devices.trust', $device->device_id) }}" method="POST">
                @csrf
                @if($device->is_trusted)
                    <button type="submit" name="action" value="untrust">Untrust Device</button>
                @else
                    <button type="submit" name="action" value="trust">Trust Device</button>
                @endif
            </form>
        </div>
    </div>
@endforeach
```

## Getting Current Device ID

To get the current device's fingerprint:

```php
use Rappasoft\LaravelAuthenticationLog\Helpers\DeviceFingerprint;

$currentDeviceId = DeviceFingerprint::generate(request());
$deviceName = DeviceFingerprint::generateDeviceName(request());
```
